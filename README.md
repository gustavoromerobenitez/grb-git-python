GRB-GIT-PYTHON

This repository contains an opinionated library that manipulates Git repositories. The library also includes some functions that interact at a basic level with the Github API. Credentials are retrieved from a GCS Bucket.

There is also a bunch of utility scripts and some unit tests.
